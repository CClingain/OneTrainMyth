Overview
========================================================

- An urban myth exists among Staten Islanders: the 1 train is named after exactly how many minutes you'll miss the ferry by.
-  Considering that the 1 train's final destination is South Ferry -- the station that connects to the Staten Island Ferry -- this is concerning.
- Staten Islanders have some of the longest commutes in the country, and the Staten Island ferry is also a major tourist attraction.


Research Questions
========================================================

1) What does the distribution of lateness look like for connections between the 1 train and the Staten Island Ferry?

2) How does this distribution vary across time (e.g., rush hour vs tourist peak)?

3) How does this distribution vary for people who can run versus people who can't run from the 1 train to the ferry?
